# UR10PickAndPlace readmeFile
See the video **[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h7UCMDZQhQ&feature=youtu.be)**
   
   It's a very simple script using matlab and Vrep APIs the project works on UR10 and could be modified to 
   work with UR3 or UR5, it need a lot of enhancements to be better but i thought it would be helpful to
   put it here so feel free to use it.
   
## Sources 
    if you don't know much about the Vrep or Peter Corke, i think 
    the below links could help you to know more about them

 - **Peter Corke robotics toolbox And some good video tutorials about it :**
   1. Downlaod the robotics toolbox:
   
      You can find it inside this repo **[Here](/Main/RoboticsToolbox_installation/)**
      Or you can downlaod it from **[Peter Corke Website](https://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox)**.
       
          I just used the toolbox to get the inverse kinematics of the robotic arm using the DH Parameter.
   2. See the Peter Corke robotics toolbox Manual to understand the detailed implementation of the Peter corke functions, 
       download it from **[Peter Corke Website](https://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox)**.
       
   3. Forward and inverse kinematics using MATLAB **[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdzAq-mPC-4&t=37s)** \[ Sorry for the **_bad resolution_** :')) \].
   4. DH Parameter using Peter corke toolbox **[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvtD1tgpC3s&list=PLR1KtmaCt9BkKra5-2jrTwjvLgLCKm-Wc&index=14)** \[ it has an **_English Subtitle_**  \].
     
- **Some useful tutorials in how to use Vrep:**      
  1. V-Rep Introduction and Bump Sensor Implementation **[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w68jmN1IBpo&list=PL38P7Q24q4XA7c0uNj0kO4or-bKhFYdIg)**
          
          In the video, you will find out How to connect between Matlab & Vrep
  2. Matlab with VREP connection another **[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk22-88xTCU&t=368s)**  \[ But unfortunately, it's in In the **_Arabic_** language ]
  3.  Matlab Robot Simulation with V-REP - Part 1 **[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piI5wYEXUms&t=4s)**  
 
          In the video, you will understand how to remotely control your robot in the verp from a Matlab Script
   4. Remote API Functions ( For [Matlab](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/remoteApiFunctionsMatlab.htm) ).
   
          In the Remote API functions (Matlab) website you will find out how to use the API functions for Matlab
